| 2 | `ebook.html` | E-book page (ebook1.html is in sitemap) |

## Recommendations

1. **Add links to `sparkverse.html`** — This is the main hub page but currently only links to `index.html`, `presentation.html`, `privacy-policy.html`, and `terms-of-service.html`. The 50+ tool pages listed on the hub appear to be display-only text without clickable links.

2. **High-priority orphans** — Pages marked as priority 0.8 in the sitemap (daily-reset, spark-protocol, sovereignty-dashboard, soul-map, spark-battle-arena, member-hub, sparkverse-hub) are considered important but have zero incoming links.

3. **Consider removing or archiving** completely hidden pages that may no longer be needed (tools-new.html, The_First_Spark_Pitch_Deck_REDESIGNED.html, invest/index.html, playerslounge/index.html).

4. **Add a tools directory** — The `tools.html` page exists and is reachable via script.js, but it doesn't link to any individual tool pages. Making it a clickable directory would solve most orphan issues.
