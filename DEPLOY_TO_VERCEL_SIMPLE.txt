HOW IT WORKS WITH WIX
================================================================================

FLOW:

1. Member visits your Wix site
2. They pay on Wix (your payment flow)
3. You manually add them to Supabase with tier level
4. Member goes to member hub
5. They login with same email they used on Wix
6. They see content for their tier
7. Done!

MANUAL STEP: You add members to Supabase after they pay on Wix
├─ Go to Supabase > Tables > profiles
├─ Click "Insert row"
├─ Add their email
├─ Set their tier (free/premium/soul_map/lifetime)
└─ They can now login!

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Deploy this member hub to Vercel ← YOU ARE HERE
2. Test it with a few member accounts
3. Add sample content to Supabase
4. Create sample soul maps
5. Link from your Wix site to the member hub

Optional:
- Set up a welcome email sequence
- Create member onboarding flow
- Build admin panel for content management
- Add community features

================================================================================
YOUR VERCEL URL
================================================================================

Once deployed, your member hub lives at:

Share this with members!

You can also:
- Add a custom domain in Vercel settings
- Connect your own domain name
- Make it yourdomain.com/members or similar
